# My Portfolio

### ðŸ‘‹Hey! I'm Harold( Rold for short) a graduating Electronics Engineering Student. 

I'm familiar with programming languages such as Python, SQL, Arduino, etc. I'm also familiar with design and electronics circuit design. Currently, I'm passionate about data management and am currently studying to pursue a career in data engineering â›ƒ.

You could say Iâ€™m on a data-driven journeyâ€”organizing chaos, one byte at a time. Letâ€™s connect and explore opportunities in tech and data! ðŸš€


My official portfolio website is still on going. Thank you for understanding
